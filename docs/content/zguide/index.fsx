zguide
===================

[The zguide][zguide] is a well-written, exhaustive explanation of the library. 
It should definitely be read. And then read again. Also, while the zguide features examples in many languages, 
the [F#-specific zguide code samples][zguidefs] have been collected here as a convenience.

--------------------

 * [Hello World server](hwserver.html) ... Expects "Hello" from client, replies with "World"
 * [Hello World client](hwclient.html) ... Sends "Hello" to server, expects "World" back

 * more to come
