### An F# binding for the 0MQ light-weight messaging kernel.

**This project is at an early stage of development.** Its stable, but requires more testing and polishing.

It provides a complete binding to version 2.1.6 of 0MQ. This binding is primarily designed to be consumed from F#. However, where possible, the library has been designed to appear "friendly" when consumed by other .NET languages (C#, et aliam).

At this point in time, fs-zmq has been tested against the .NET runtime on 64-bit Windows 7 and 32-bit Windows XP. Other platform/architecture/runtime combinations will be tested in due course.

fs-zmq has three (3) pre-requisites:
  
   1. Microsoft .NET runtime, version 4.0
   2. Microsoft F# run-time for .NET 4.0
   3. libzmq, version 2.1.6
