### An F# binding for the ZeroMQ light-weight messaging kernel.

**This project is at an early stage of development.** Its stable, but requires more testing and polishing.

It provides a complete binding to the 3.x branch of ZeroMQ. This library is primarily designed to be consumed from F#. However, where possible, the API has been designed to appear "friendly" when consumed by other .NET languages (C#, et aliam).

More details to follow.
